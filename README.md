# APImachinelearning
Machine Learning (ML) is a valuable tool for jobs that can't be explicitly coded, such image classification. Deployment is a critical step in the machine learning process. The approach for the REST API that we aim to provide is image categorization. We'll utilize Google Image to look for food images because we're using food as our data set, thus we'll do a food photo query. Following that, the server will provide the response, which will be a collection of food photos.
