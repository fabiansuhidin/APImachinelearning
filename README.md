# APImachinelearning
Machine Learning (ML) is a valuable tool for jobs that can't be explicitly coded, such image classification. Deployment is a critical step in the machine learning process. The approach for the REST API that we aim to provide is image categorization. We'll utilize Google Image to look for food images because we're using food as our data set, thus we'll do a food photo query. Following that, the server will provide the response, which will be a collection of food photos.

# Kafka Implementation
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that makes data integration between systems easier. A stream is a data pipeline that your apps use to receive data on a regular basis.

The Kafka system is made up of three basic parts:

A Producer is a service that generates data that has to be broadcast, which I implemented with the Flask API.

A Broker: This is Kafka himself, who serves as a go-between for the producer and the consumer. It makes use of APIs to obtain and broadcast data.

A consumer is a service that makes use of the information that the broker will disseminate.

Creating a basic streaming application that displays a video file from our producer in a web browser.
